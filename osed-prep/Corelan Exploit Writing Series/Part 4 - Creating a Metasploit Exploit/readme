exploit reliable:

- used msvc 2022, disable all security checks

- modified source code to include a gadget that we can use that points back to our payload

- however, because our shellcode is within the padding, is very hard to convert it to a metasploit exploit. should be possible but lazy... lol...

- when exploit is run, pop up appears: "Debug error, c++ debug error run-time check failre #2", then you have the option to abort, retry or ignore. press ignore. this is possibly some protection scheme to prevent bof by MSVC 2022


INSTALLATION of MSVC 2022 somehow messes up with ALL buffer overflow exploit. Dky.
