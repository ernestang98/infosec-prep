# LiveOverflow Binary Exploitation / Memory Corruption

Series made by YouTube LiveOverflow on learning fundamentals of binary exploitation and reverse engineering

Used Protostar Exploit Education resource throughout his tutorial

### Notes:

- From 0x00 - 0x1f, majority of the exploits were and are compiled without memory protection schemes (e.g. ASLR, DEP), hence they would not work if compiled on a modern OS.
