snmpwalk -v1 -c public 10.129.95.189 NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendObjects

public is a popular folder, may not always be public, get folder name via enumeration/bruteforce


using snmpwalk, get seeddms directory and michelle username

guess/brute force password (michelle)

seeddms exploit, to get directory of upload, upload cmdshell (cuz alot of restrictions)

using cmdshell, enumerate system and get password (multiple conf files, use the correct one to get the password for :9090 admin console)

using michelle again with the password authenticate



run ps -auxw and then find . -name monitor, realise that root is running monitor

monitor is a actually a bash script that looks at /usr/local/monitoring/check_sh scripts and executes them

try to cp over bash file but permissions denied, alot of restrictions

add own ssh key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and you're good to go :)
