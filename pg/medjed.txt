Unintended way (port 33033, 44330):

http://192.168.68.127:8000 -> create administrator -> home page -> menu -> administrator panel (navigate to 44330 ssl site) -> customize server -> upload images to cmsdocs

we realise that we can navigate through the various directories and choose where we can upload our files

we realise that /cmsdocs directory is the base directory for the 44330 webserver

https://192.168.68.127:44330/flower.txt (proof)

we also realise that the server is using lsp lua server pages

https://192.168.68.127:44330/rtl/protected/admin/customize.lsp

afterwhich, you got it, instant root lol

nmapAutomator full scan lol..., always do your own full manual scan as well...






By right way:

/phpinfo -> find path of base directories of webservers on host (port 45332, 45443)

remember to not skip your web enumeration... perform gobuster (and everything else) on everything!


move on port 33033

enumerate information of people on website
