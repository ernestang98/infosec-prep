file upload:

realise that we cant upload .aspx or .asp files

further more, all files uploaded converted to .txt and cannot change that (use burpsuit or console to verify)

i.e. to say, only .txt files can be uploaded and any other files will automatically be appended with .txt

/dev file reveals the site file, and shows that it is using site.master.cs found here https://github.com/autofac/Examples/blob/master/src/WebFormsExample/Site.Master.cs

create a reverse shell combining the above and a cs reverse shell found here https://gist.github.com/BankSecurity/55faad0d0c4259c623147db79b2a83cc

ensure syntax and proper formatting, if not it will not work
