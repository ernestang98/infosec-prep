Similar to sneakymailer :)

Foothold:

use usernamer to generate possible usernames

/usr/share/legion/scripts/smtp-user-enum.pl to verify that usernames exists

/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt with smtp-user-enum to find out that hr and sales exists and probably it and legal as well

1. Can immediately try a client side attack by whacking all of the emails using the script provided by sneakymailer htb but alternatively...

2. use hydra bruteforce pop3 with secured usernames + departments to get sales:sales (try not to do this as you may get banned)
