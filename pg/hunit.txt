get git user ssh key (to be used to git clone git-server repo)

look at /etc/crontab.bak

GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i rootkey -p 43022' git clone git@192.168.68.125:/git-server
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ../rootkey -p 43022' git push origin master

you know how it is

dademola -> git -> root


careful to not use sudo in your backup script as sudo is not found in the system

make sure to change the permissions of your script as git also monitors file permissions (can test it out using chmod)
