do full port scan


foothold:

ftp -> rabbitmq -> .erlang.cookie

erlang port mapper cookie exploit
port 65000 (obtained from 4367 enumeration - see hacktricks for sample output, if dk just try all the ports lol)

actually would have gotten it if my nmap scans were faster :P

the rest are rabbitholes


privesc:

suid nmap
